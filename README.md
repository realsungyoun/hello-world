# hello-world
Repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others. 
Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. 
  Default branch is named master, the definitive branch, use braches to experiment and make edis before committing them to master.
  A new branch is called feature because we are doing feature work.
  The journey that feature takes beefore its merged into master.
To create a new branch, go to repository, drop down of branch:master, type a branch name, into the new branch text box., then select the blue create branch box or hit enter.
  Now you have two branches.
Make and commit changes.
    Saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a       particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of our changes so others can understand.
  Click the branch, click pencil, write a commit message that describes your changes, commit changes.
